How to use the Darcy Flight Sim: <br />
simDriver: only script you need to run. executes the entire simulation. <br />
simSetup: one of two functions you need to edit. allows you to change any and all parameters in the sim. <br />
engineSetup: the other function you need to edit. allows you to change any and all engine parameters. <br />
important notes: only single-simulation (no Monte Carlo) 1 and 3 DOF sims are functional right now
